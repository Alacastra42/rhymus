# Rhymus

An open-source rhyming game project designed for new developers and first-time contributors.

## Gameplay

Rhymus is an open-source game that will display cards with sentences on them. Each sentence will have one word that doesn't quite make sense but rhymes with a word that does. For example, 'I want to buy a fog.' -> Answer: 'Dog'. A timer gives you 30 seconds to complete as many as possible.

## Design

This project will go through **two phases**. The first will be an initial build using a Node back-end and HTML, CSS, and JS front-end. For the first build, there will be no React/Redux implementation.

Once the first build is complete and feature-complete, a new branch will be created in which the project will be refactored using React.

## Contributions

This project is starting from scratch, so there are ample opportunities to contribute. Any of the following is a great way to contribute:

- Editing the README
- Creating new files for the project structure
- Restructuring the project to comply with best practices
- Coding any of the front-end or back-end
- Coding test files
- Offering alternative styling
- Suggesting better practices for GitHub management (including contribution guidelines)

## Contribution Guidelines

When you contribute, please use the following guidelines:

- Name your branch in a way that reflects what you plan on doing ('implement-card-scrolling')
- Provide detailed information in your pull request regarding what you did and why it is done that way
- In your pull request, reflect on your code and include comments as to whether it may need refactoring or if anything was particularly difficult
- Include tests with your contribution if applicable

This is an open-source project for developers of all experience levels. Please show common courtesy and provide constructive feedback where possible.
